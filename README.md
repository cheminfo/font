## Add new fonts

Just create new files in the `svg` directory. They must have a 1000x1000 size.  
Inkscape has a template for this: File => Templates => Fontforge Glyph

## Build the fonts

Run `npm run build`.  
The fonts will be generated in the `dest` directory along with a CSS and HTML files to check the results.
